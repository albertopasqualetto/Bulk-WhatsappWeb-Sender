This tool permits people to send WhatsApp messages in bulk through WhatsApp Web with a nice CLI interface.

**This software is not completely reliable and tested!**

## How to

Download your relative OS .zip, decompress it, open a terminal in the folder and start the program (`index.exe` in Windows and `./index` in Linux; in Linux you may have to give execute permissions).

Numbers without country prefix fallback on the same country prefix of the sender number.

:x: It is not able to send gifs and to send all the content of a folder.

Ignore the warning on startup, it is not a problem.


This is based on the beautiful [whatsapp-web.js node package](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js).

## Build

To create an executable in order to use it on a computer without Node.js installed.

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Then, open a terminal in the project folder and run `npm install` and `npm run build`.

It will be slow.
