This tool permits people to send WhatsApp messages in bulk through WhatsApp Web with a nice CLI interface.

**This software is not completely reliable and tested!**

Actually there are [some bans reported by users](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/issues/1872), so use it at your own risk!!

## How to

Download your relative OS .zip, decompress it, open a terminal in the folder and start the program with `npm run start`, then follow the instructions.

Numbers without country prefix fallback on the same country prefix of the sender number.

:x: It is not able to send gifs and to send all the content of a folder.

:x: It can only send videos with a maximum size of 16MB and documents with a maximum size of 100MB.

:x: Temporarily videos are sent as documents (with 100MB limit).

This is based on the beautiful [whatsapp-web.js node package](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js).

## Build (with CAXA)

To create an executable in order to use it on a computer without Node.js installed.

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Then, open a terminal in the project folder and run `npm install` and `npm run build`.

It will be slow.
